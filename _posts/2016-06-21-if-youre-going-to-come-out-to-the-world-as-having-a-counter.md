  If you're going to come out to the world as having a counter-cultural
  worldview in the 21st Century, one can hardly avoid reference to the late,
  great Terence McKenna. Although my view of the famous ethnobotanist, student,
  and shaman of the alchemical foundations of human consciousness has changed
  over the decades since his many writings changed the way I perceive the nature
  of the human condition in the cosmos, I can say that his writings and lectures
  have had more impact on my worldview than any person I never personally met.

If you're going to come out to the world as having a counter-cultural worldview in the 21st Century, one can hardly avoid reference to the late, great [Terence McKenna][0]. Although my view of the famous ethnobotanist, student, and shaman of the alchemical foundations of human consciousness has changed over the decades since his many writings changed the way I perceive the nature of the human condition in the cosmos, I can say that his writings and lectures have had more impact on my worldview than any person I never personally met. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1011a1c-bfd9-4555-922f-99fe5e916abb.jpg)

Much like the ethos of Bill Hicks, for many who know and love him, can be encapsulated in the "[It's Just a Ride][1]" summary of his 1993 stand up comedy routine entitled [_Revelations_][2], the message McKenna appears to have come to share is the simple phrase, "[Culture is not your friend][3]," a rhetorical side-jaunt expanded upon in a lecture given in Seattle in 1999, entitled [_Psychedelics in the Age of Intelligent Machines_][4]. Although McKenna's literary exploits primarily explore the author's first-person experience with plant-based entheogens, or psychedelics, and treatises on the nature of time, human language, and consciousness in regards to that experiential frame, some of his most poignant moments are those in which he explains his view of how that which we regard as human "culture" retards our psycho-spiritual development in exchange for a machine-like cognitive prison. 

In the early 90's, I sought someone out who could explain what had happened to me under the influence of a fairly strong dose of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms. Around the age of twenty, I can say that I had never experienced joy like what I experienced during that experience. The heart-opening I felt on that occasion and on subsequent other similar experiences led me to McKenna's [_The Archaic Revival: Speculations on Psychedelic Mushrooms, the Amazon, Virtual Reality, UFOs, Evolution, Shamanism, the Rebirth of the Goddess, and the End of History_][5] and [_Food Of The Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge_][6]. These books, and later others, did not lead me to an explication of the heart-opening facilities of these plant medicines so much as the long-standing history of their use in spiritual practice and the theory that their use may acted as a kind of accelerant for human cognition -- particularly for the purposes of visual and linguistic acuity. From the perspective of my upbringing, all of this would have been considered heretical anathema to the Judeo Christian values I had been taught since childhood, but made sense of portions of reality I had always been aware of but dared not explore. I continue to be thankful not only for those early magical experiences, but for the teachings conveyed by Terence McKenna while he was still teaching on this plane. I hope to meet him some day.
