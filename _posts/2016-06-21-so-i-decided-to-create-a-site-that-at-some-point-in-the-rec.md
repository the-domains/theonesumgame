  So I decided to create a site that, at some point in the recent past, might
  have acted as a sort of apology for why my thinking is -- by any traditional
  American standard -- weird. I thought "Who are the people that have helped me
  to shape the way I look at the world, and how can I showcase how each of their
  contributions to my own cognitive frame have brought me to want to build a
  site entitled the One sum game?"

![Bill Hicks (1962 - 1994)](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/38f03445-66a5-4cf3-8d3e-2873abc96446.jpg)

However, what I've come to realize is that the underlying theme of the site, Unity Consciousness, is less and less weird to people who have been paying attention to the deterioration of every institution previous generations established, held dear, and assumed would continue to support humanity into... what?... perpetuity I suppose. They're not -- they're broken and we have an opportunity to see ourselves in new ways and to re-envision the ways we organize ourselves as the singular (?) curatorial species on a planet ever-more stressed under the demands we place upon it. 

At some point, I had considered the site name of "the Zero sum game," wherein I would look critically at all of the ways we've screwed up this reality we all share; but then I decided, "Why give _that _power, when what we have is an opportunity to re-imagine everything on a global scale... together?" And so this brings me to my choice of the patron saint for this site: [Bill Hicks][0]. I won't even try to channel the comedic philosophy of the relentless sane man that admonished us to "Love All the People," but his wisdom (interwoven with dick jokes) resonates with many people more than a decade after his untimely death. I'll leave the link to his official website for now, but I'm sure we will return to talk about him later.
